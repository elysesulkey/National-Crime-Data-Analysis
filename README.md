# National Crime Data Analysis

The goal of this project was to analyse crime data reported by the FBI for the years 2018-2019 to find the most violent state.

Since the raw data only provided reports for cities with populations over 100k, we soon realized our data would only be able to describe urbanized areas in each state. With this in mind, we built a heat map using leaflet to visualize the rate of crime in each state. In future projects, we'd like to access more complete records for each state and/or expand the record years for a more comprehensive analysis.

Our group also created visualizations using D3 and plotly, focusing on crime frequency, average crime numbers by crime type, and state averages standardized by population.
