# National Crime Data Analysis

The goal of this project was to analyse crime data reported by the FBI for the years 2018-2019 to find the most violent state.

Since the raw data only provided reports for cities with populations over 100k, we soon realized our data would only be able to describe urbanized areas in each state. In future projects, we'd like to access more complete records for each state and/or expand the record years for a more comprehensive analysis. 


Our group hardcoded our dashboard visualizations using D3 and plotly, as well as utilizing leaflet for our crime heatmap.
